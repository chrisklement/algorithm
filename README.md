#Project Algorithm

***First confrontation and encounter with algorithm. Initially in an analoge form and afterwards into digital conversion by Processing.***

##Analog

For the first confrontation with an algorithm, the task was to think of a self-generated algorithm in human langauage. The focus was strongly on the accuracy of the statement in order to achieve the desired result. To produce more variants, it was important to maintain a clear controlled flexibility in the algorithm.

For testing the algorithm, 10 people were asked to perform it. The first time just with crayons and templates on paper. In the following some results:

###Algorithm – Code (paper)

1. Choose a color as you like and draw maximum 10 equal circles randomly. The condition is that the circles must not overlap. From the center of all connect all circles together with a line with the same color

2. With another color draw as many circles as space is available. The condition is that the circles do not overlap and may be connected with a line.

After the first implementation, I should improve our existing algorithm on the basis of the first results. In addition, more emphasis should be placed on the technical equipment that were available to the persons, thus creating artisitic object.

After that I decided to use the following paraphernalia:
A black patch panel made of rigid foam, circles made of cork, white thumbtacks and thread.

###Algorithm – Code (breadboard)

1. Put on your work area with the aid of pins and the thin white thread. It should be the minimum a half of the available space.

2. Put any number of circles in size of your choice, in your chosen work area. They may not overlap.

3. From the center of all connect any number of cirlces with pin and thread. They can all be connected individually or together.

##Digital

After that, the input of human language should be programmed into a digital algorithm. It was free to decide whether one wanted to work with Python or Java in Processing. Since I have a little previous experience in Java, I decided to use it.
In the following some results:
