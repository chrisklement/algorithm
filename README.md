# Project Algorithm

***First confrontation and encounter with algorithms. Initially, in an analog form and afterwards into digital conversion by Processing.***

## Analog

For the first confrontation with an algorithm, the task was to think of a self-generated algorithm in human language. The focus was strongly on the accuracy of the statement, in order to achieve the desired result. To produce more variants, it was important to maintain a clear controlled flexibility in the algorithm.

For testing the algorithm, 10 people were asked to perform it. The first time just with crayons and templates on paper. In the following some results:

### Algorithm – Code (paper)

1. Choose a color as you like and draw at maximum 10 equal circles randomly. The condition is that the circles should not overlap. From the center of the circles, connect them all with a line of the same color.

2. With another color, draw as many circles as the available space allows. The condition is that the circles do not overlap and should not be connected with a line.

After the first implementation, I should improve the existing algorithm on the basis of the first results. In addition, more emphasis should be placed on the technical equipment that was available to the persons and thus enabling them to create artistic objects.

After that I decided to use the following utensils:
A black patch panel made of rigid foam, circles made of cork, white thumbtacks and thread.

### Algorithm – Code (breadboard)

1. Define your work area with the aid of pins and the thin white thread. It should be at least the half of the available space.

2. Put as many circles as you want to and in the size of your choice in your chosen work area. They may not overlap.

3. From the center of the circles, connect as many circles as you wish to do, with pin and thread. They can all be connected individually or together.

## Digital

After that, the input of human language should be programmed into a digital algorithm. It was free to decide whether one wanted to work with Python or Java in Processing. Since I already had a bit experience with Java, I decided to use it.
In the following some results:
